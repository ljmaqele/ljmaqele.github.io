## About Me

I am a PhD candidate in the Inclusive Sustainable Systems (INSYST) lab in the Sustainability Department of the Golisano Institute for Sustainability at Rochester Institute of Technology.  I research energy justice. I apply data analytics and machine learning techniques and build techno-economic decision-support tools that help inform electrification policy. My PhD dissertation quantifies rural electrification subsidies over the system lifetime and explores policy mechanisms to consider in order to accelerate electricity access in underserved communities by 'correctly structuring' and 'efficiently allocating' subsidies to a portfolio of technology options including central grid extension and decentralized energy systems to improve energy equity.

Over the years as a graduate student, I have engaged on a number of interesting, practical software development and data science projects as an independent contractor and intern at [Green Design Institute](https://www.cmu.edu/epp/research/research-centers/), [Onepower](https://1pwrafrica.com) and [National Renewable Energy Laboratory](https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/dgen/).

I hold a MS in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/academics/ms-ece/) from [Carnegie Mellon University, Africa](https://www.cmu.edu/https://www.africa.engineering.cmu.edu/) in Rwanda and a BEng in [Mechanical Engineering](https://www.ub.bw/discover/faculties/engineering-and-technology/mechanical-engineering) from the [University of Botswana](https://www.ub.bw) in Gaborone Botswana.

## Research Summary

My research focuses on developing cost-effective and pervasive electric grid sensing solutions using existing infrastructure such as digital cameras, satellite imagery, and computing tools such as machine learning and deep learning. I explore and develop both localized and wide-area monitoring solutions. Localized monitoring uses cameras to evaluate the phase and quality of electricity at the edges of distribution grids, with the aim of creating an economical solution for utilities that cannot afford expensive smart meter deployments. However, scaling localized camera-based monitoring to a larger area such as a country-wide scale can be challenging, which is where wide-area monitoring comes in. My wide-area monitoring work combines large amounts of satellite images and ground-collected data to estimate electrification status, power supply inconsistencies, and their impacts at high spatiotemporal resolution across a wide area. This research aims to generate historical, high-resolution outage maps of 500 cities in the US and 300 cities in Africa and make them publicly accessible, enabling global comparisons of utility performance, tracking the success of grid investments, and complementing various infrastructure surveys and research studies.
